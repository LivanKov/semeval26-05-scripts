The user asks: Are you the last goal? They might mean did you score the last goal in the game? Or do you have the same objective?

analysisWe need to analyze if 'goal' means this meaning in this context. 'goal' is ambiguous: could be objective or could be soccer net. 'delivered' implies she scored. So 'deliver' implies delivering the ball into the net. So 'goal' likely refers to the soccer goal. So 'delivered' implies she scored. So is the meaning plausible? Yes, she delivered the goal (she scored). So 'deliver' implies she delivered the goal meaning she scored. So likely she delivered the meaning: successful attempt at scoring in soccer. So rating 4.
